## ðŸ”§ Technical Priorities

### **Critical Path Items** (Cannot be delayed)
1. **Maze Generation** (Week 1-2) - Foundation for everything
2. **Player Controller** (Week 1) - Required for testing
3. **Sanity System** (Week 3) - Core mechanic dependency
4. **Exit Gate** (Week 4) - Win condition requirement
5. **Harvest System** (Week 5) - Unique selling point

### **Nice-to-Have Features** (Cut if needed)
- Advanced Watcher AI behaviors
- Complex audio mixing
- Multiple weird thing subtypes
- Advanced visual effects
- Additional landmark puzzles

---

## ðŸ“Š Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### **High Risk Areas**
1. **3D Maze Performance** - May need optimization or simplification
2. **Harvest System Complexity** - Could be simplified to basic logging
3. **Entity AI** - May need to reduce complexity if time-constrained

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Daily Progress Check** - Reassess timeline every 3 days
- **Feature Prioritization** - Cut nice-to-haves if behind schedule
- **Prototype Fallback** - Can revert to 2D if 3D proves too complex

## ðŸŽ¯ Definition of Success (MVP)

By September 28, the game must have:
- âœ… **Playable maze** with shifting mechanics
- âœ… **Functional sanity** system with feedback
- âœ… **Basic weird things** collection (minimum 3 types)
- âœ… **Watcher entity** with spawning
- âœ… **Exit gate** with key requirement
- âœ… **Harvest logging** system with timestamped runs
- âœ… **At least 1 echo** spawning in subsequent runs

**Success Metric:** A complete playthrough from start to finish that demonstrates the core "harvest" concept and replayability mechanic.
